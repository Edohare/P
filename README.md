Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

This is my machine learning portfolio, this folder is from before I started working full-time as a data scientist and is no longer a full look at my skills as I have learned so much more through working. However, I still think it is important to have a portfolio for recruiters and colleagues to look at.

These projects will not always be perfected, they are about learning and showing different techniques. Alot of the projects are from courses that I take in order to teach myself and continue learning.
