<b>PLEASE READ: This portfolio is no longer a full look into my skills, as I have learned so much through working full time as a data scientist.</b> However, I still think it is important to have a portfolio, and the projects can give a decent idea of my skills as a data scientist as I still use some of the techniques within this portfolio on a day to day basis. Just please understand it is not a full view. Thank you!
